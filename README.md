# Data-Cleaning-Stack-Overflow-Survey-Trends

Stack Overflow Survey Trends

### Description
This project based on the learning resources provided by Codecademy explores the trends of the technology market by analyzing a Stack Overflow dataset that contains survey responses by developers from all over the world for the last few years. The focus relies on cleaning the data so colleagues and stakeholders can manipulate it easily.

### Data
The data used for this project comes from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for the years 2018-2020, which is an annual survey that collects data on various aspects of the developer community, such as demographics, skills, preferences, challenges, etc. The data is in CSV format and contains the following variables:

- RespondentID: The unique identifier of the respondent.
- Year: The year in which the survey was conducted.
- Country: The name of the country where the respondent lives.
- Employment: The employment status of the respondent.
- DevType: The developer type or role of the respondent.
- UndergradMajor: The undergraduate major or field of study of the respondent.
- YearsCodePro: The number of years that the respondent has coded professionally.
- ConvertedComp: The annual compensation of the respondent in US dollars.
- NEWJobHunt: The reasons why the respondent is or is not looking for a new job.
- NEWJobHuntResearch: The methods or sources that the respondent uses to look for a new job.
- NEWLearn: The frequency that the respondent learns a new technology or skill.
 
### Tools
The following tools were used for the analysis:

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents with code, text, graphics, etc.
- Pandas: For data structures and operations.
- Numpy: For mathematical functions and operations.
- Seaborn: For statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib: For two-dimensional graphics.
- Scikit-learn: For data imputation.

### Results
The results can be seen in [stack_overflow_survey_trends.ipynb], which has the code, the comments and the graphs of the analysis.
